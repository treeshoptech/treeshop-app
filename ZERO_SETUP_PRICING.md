# TreeShop Zero-Setup Pricing System

## Start Pricing Work Immediately - No Configuration Required

TreeShop uses a **Two-Tier Pricing System** that lets you create proposals on day one, then tracks actual costs as you complete jobs.

---

## How It Works

### Tier 1: PROPOSALS (No Setup Required) ✅

**Auto-Seeded Service Templates** provide industry-standard pricing out of the box:

| Service Type | Production Rate | Billing Rate | Target Margin |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Forestry Mulching** | 1.3 PPH | $450/hr | 45% |
| **Land Clearing** | 0.8 PPH | $700/hr | 45% |
| **Stump Grinding** | 400 PPH | $300/hr | 45% |
| **Tree Removal** | 250 PPH | $520/hr | 45% |
| **Tree Trimming** | 180 PPH | $425/hr | 45% |
| **Brush Clearing** | 2.5 PPH | $265/hr | 45% |

**What happens automatically:**
1. When you first open **Settings → Line Items**, service templates are created
2. All calculators immediately work with these industry averages
3. You can start creating proposals right away
4. Prices are **locked** when proposal is created (protects your margins)

**Workflow:**
```
Customer Call → Select Calculator → Enter Job Details + AFISS Factors →
Generate Proposal → Customer Signs → Proposal Locked ✓
```

---

### Tier 2: WORK ORDERS (Loadouts Required) 📋

**Loadouts** track your **actual** equipment and labor costs for completed work:

**What is a Loadout?**
- Equipment assignment (e.g., CAT 265 Mulcher + F450 Truck + Trailer)
- Crew assignment (e.g., Operator + Ground Crew)
- Real production rate (your crew's actual PPH)
- True costs (your actual hourly costs)

**Why Loadouts Matter:**
- Track actual vs. estimated costs
- Improve future estimates with real data
- Monitor equipment utilization
- Calculate true job profitability
- Refine service templates over time

**Workflow:**
```
Signed Proposal → Assign Loadout → Create Work Order →
Track Time & Costs → Complete Job → Calculate Actual Profitability
```

---

## The Complete Workflow

### Phase 1: Customer Acquisition (Day 1)
**Goal:** Get signed proposals immediately

1. Customer calls about a job
2. You open the appropriate calculator (Mulching, Stumps, etc.)
3. Enter job details:
   - Acreage or stump count
   - AFISS complexity factors (site conditions)
4. Calculator shows price range using **service template** standards
5. Generate professional proposal
6. Customer signs → **Proposal locked** ✓

**No equipment setup needed.** **No crew configuration needed.** Just start pricing.

---

### Phase 2: Job Execution (After First Few Jobs)
**Goal:** Track actual costs and performance

1. Create your first **Loadout** in Settings:
   - Add your equipment with real costs
   - Add your employees with real wages
   - Set your actual production rates
2. Assign loadout to signed proposal → Creates Work Order
3. Crew completes work with time tracking
4. System calculates:
   - Estimated cost (from service template)
   - Actual cost (from loadout)
   - Profit variance
   - Actual vs. estimated hours

---

### Phase 3: Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)
**Goal:** Refine pricing with real data

As you complete jobs:
- **Service templates auto-update** with actual performance data
- Your PPH (Points Per Hour) gets more accurate
- Your cost estimates improve
- Your pricing becomes more competitive

**The Feedback Loop:**
```
Proposal (Template) → Work Order (Loadout) → Job Completion →
Performance Analysis → Template Refinement → Better Next Proposal
```

---

## When Do I Need Loadouts?

### ✅ You CAN create proposals WITHOUT loadouts
- Service templates provide pricing
- Industry-standard production rates
- Professional proposals with locked pricing
- Full AFISS complexity factors

### ❌ You CANNOT create work orders WITHOUT loadouts
- Work orders require crew/equipment assignment
- Time tracking needs actual resources
- Profitability analysis requires real costs
- Performance metrics need actual PPH

---

## Industry-Standard Starting Values

Service templates use **conservative industry averages** based on:

### Forestry Mulching (CAT 265 equivalent)
- **Equipment:** Track mulcher + support truck
- **Crew:** 2 people (operator + ground support)
- **Cost:** $247.50/hr fully-loaded
- **Production:** 1.3 Mulching Score points/hr
- **Billing:** $450/hr → 45% margin

### Stump Grinding
- **Equipment:** Stump grinder + trailer
- **Crew:** 1-2 people
- **Cost:** $165/hr fully-loaded
- **Production:** 400 StumpScore points/hr
- **Billing:** $300/hr → 45% margin

### Land Clearing (Heavy)
- **Equipment:** Excavator + support equipment
- **Crew:** 2-3 people
- **Cost:** $385/hr fully-loaded
- **Production:** 0.8 Clearing Score points/hr
- **Billing:** $700/hr → 45% margin

**These are starting points.** Your actual costs and production rates will vary based on:
- Equipment age and condition
- Crew experience level
- Local market conditions
- Operating efficiency

---

## Smart Defaults Strategy

### Why 45% Target Margin?

**45% is the tree care industry standard** for:
- ✅ Covers unexpected costs and complexity
- ✅ Accounts for non-billable time
- ✅ Provides buffer for AFISS adjustments
- ✅ Competitive but protects profitability
- ✅ Room for discounts without losing money

**Formula Used:**
```
Billing Rate = Cost ÷ (1 - Margin%)
$450 = $247.50 ÷ (1 - 0.45)
$450 = $247.50 ÷ 0.55
```

**NOT:** `Cost × (1 + Markup%)` ← This gives wrong margin!

---

## AFISS: The Competitive Moat

**Access, Facilities, Irregularities, Site, Safety**

35+ complexity factors automatically adjust pricing:
- Narrow gate access: +12%
- Power lines nearby: +15%
- Building within 50ft: +20%
- Wetlands on site: +20%
- Protected species: +30%

**Example:**
- Base job: 20 Mulching Score points
- AFISS multiplier: 1.47× (3 factors selected)
- Adjusted score: 29.4 points
- Hours: 29.4 ÷ 1.3 PPH = 22.6 hrs
- Price: 22.6 × $450 = **$10,170**

**Without AFISS:** Same job priced at $6,923 → 32% underpriced → lost $3,247

## FAQ

### Q: Can I edit service templates?
**A:** Yes! Service templates are **starting points**. Adjust them based on:
- Your actual equipment costs
- Your labor rates and crew efficiency
- Your local market rates
- Your desired profit margins

### Q: Will my pricing be accurate without loadouts?
**A:** Service templates provide **industry-average** pricing that's:
- Conservative (protects your margins)
- Competitive (based on real market data)
- Adjustable (AFISS factors add site-specific complexity)

For most tree service companies, these starting values are within 10-15% of actual costs. As you create loadouts and complete jobs, your estimates become increasingly precise.

### Q: What if my costs are way different from the defaults?
**A:** Three options:
1. **Quick:** Adjust service template billing rates in Settings
2. **Better:** Create a loadout with your actual equipment/crew costs
3. **Best:** Complete a few jobs, let the system learn your actual PPH and costs

The system is designed to **learn and improve** over time.

### Q: Do I lose money if I price with templates instead of loadouts?
**A:** No! Service templates use **conservative** industry averages:
- 45% target margin (high for tree care)
- Proven PPH rates from established companies
- AFISS adds 10-50% to base pricing
- Locked pricing protects you from cost overruns

Most companies find template pricing is actually **higher** than their gut-feel estimates, which means better margins.

### Q: When should I create my first loadout?
**A:** After your first 3-5 completed jobs. By then you'll know:
- Your actual equipment hourly costs
- Your crew's real production rate (PPH)
- How your costs compare to service templates
- Which services are most profitable

Don't rush loadout creation. Service templates work great for proposals.

## Technical Notes

### Auto-Seeding Behavior
- Runs on first visit to **Settings → Line Items** page
- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Only creates templates that don't exist
- Won't overwrite your custom adjustments
- Also seeds AFISS factors (35 default factors)

### Data Storage
- Service templates: Organization-scoped (your company's standards)
- AFISS factors: System-wide + custom org factors
- Proposals: Locked at creation (preserves pricing)
- Work orders: Links to loadout (tracks actual costs)

### Pricing Formula Consistency
All calculators use the same pattern:
```javascript
// 1. Calculate work volume (service-specific formula)
baseScore = calculateWorkVolume(jobDetails)

// 2. Apply AFISS complexity multiplier
adjustedScore = baseScore × afissMultiplier

// 3. Convert to hours using service template PPH
estimatedHours = adjustedScore ÷ serviceTemplate.standardPPH

// 4. Calculate price using service template billing rate
clientPrice = estimatedHours × serviceTemplate.standardBillingRate

// 5. Lock price when proposal is created ✓
```
